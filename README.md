# Three-Number-Sum

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct intergers and an interger representing the target sum. The function should find all triplets in the array that = targetSum and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets. The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order and the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order. If no three numbers sum up to the targetSum, return empty array.


Sample input: array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6] targetSum = 0
Sample output: tripletsArr = [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
